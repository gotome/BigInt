BigInt Class C++ for all basic arithmetic operations.

The numbers are stored in dynamic arrays. This allows to calculate almost unlimited large numbers. 

Following arithmetical operations are possible:

I've overloadet some operators that comparison is Possible for two BigInt's. 
You can use following operators to compare BigInt's:
