# BigInt

BigInt Class C++ for all basic arithmetic operations.

This class allows you to do add, subtract, multiplie and divide verry large numbers.
The numbers are stored in dynamic arrays. This allows to process almost unlimited numbers. 

The division algorithm returns an integer and no floating point value. The remainder is discarded.
